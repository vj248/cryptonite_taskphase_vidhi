# Hello Hackers
Working on the first module
## Intro to Commands
Following the instructions, first I connected the WSL terminal to pwn. Then I ran the whoami command, which gave me the required output. Next, I ran the hello command which gave me the correct flag.

## Intro to Arguments
Here we have added arguments, where the input the user gives is repeated back. Following the instructions, I first ran the echo command twice, checking with single and multiple agruments. Once that worked, I ran the hello with the argument to get the required flag.
